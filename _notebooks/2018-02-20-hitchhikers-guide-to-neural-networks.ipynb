    "`learning_rate` is a **hyperparameter** that is used to control the speed and steps of gradient descent. We can tune this hyperparameter to make our gradient descent faster or slower in order to avoid mainly two problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overshooting : This means, we have jumped over the minima and are now stuck in a limbo. The value of cost function will go haywire and increase and decrease and do all sorts of things but won’t reach the global minima.\n",
    "2. Super long training time : The network takes so long to train that your body turns into a skeleton.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent these two conditions from happening, we use the learning rate which is one of the many hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that’s it, that’s all we have to do to train a network. After this, we use different evaluation metrics to test how good our network performs. And then, if we’re feeling fancy, we can use graphs to visualize what we have done.\n",
