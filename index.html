<b><i>Neuron</i></b> is my personal blog where I write about things that interest me. Topics include, but are not limited to, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, stoicism, history, productivity, and books.

As I grow, I hope this repository of my thoughts grows as well. And maybe twenty years from now, I will write something genuinely good.
